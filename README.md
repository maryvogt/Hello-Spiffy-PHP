Building and Running Spiffy UI
--------------------------------------

Hello Spiffy PHP is built with [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/) using [Apache Ivy](http://ant.apache.org/ivy/) and deployed to [PHP](http://php.net/).  Once you've installed Ant, PHP, and a web server like [Apache HTTP](http://httpd.apache.org/),  go to your Hello-Spiffy-PHP working copy and run this command:

        <ANT_HOME>/ant
        
The ant command will download the required libraries and build the Hello Spiffy PHP project. 

To deploy the Hello Spiffy PHP application, copy the contents of the target/www directory from your Hello-Spiffy-PHP working copy of to your web server server.  Run the application by accessing the index.html file.
